# Hackathon2021
We are leveraging AI to combat with a solution to tackle the problem of reading long scripted pdf for finding a particular answers to questions. 
# BotRead

This project is an effort to make the hefty job of going through tons of books, images, and reference materials in search of our desired answers or references much easier.

Using the CDQA architecture, We can scan through multiple sources at the same time and NLP is used over it to find the most relevant document as well as the most relevant answer to the query asked.

We allow users to upload data in the forms of Images, Text doucments, and PDFs. These are then converted to text. The TF-IDF features based on uni-grams and bi-grams and the cosine similarity is computed between the Query asked and the Documents available in the database to select the most relevant Document. We then use BERT with the paragraphs of the most relevant document selected and the Query provided to find the most relevant part of the paragraph that has the most potential to be our desired answer.
